# Extension

This is a [3DSlicer](https://www.slicer.org/) extension made for the prosthetic design process. Using it will decrease the time needed to mark bones and nerves in CT scans, allowing patients to get prosthetics faster.

To prepare your machine for testing, do the following:

1. Install the **nightly** build of 3DSlicer for your operating system, found [here](http://download.slicer.org/).
2. Download the "Demo DICOM.zip" file provided by the FastSlice team, found [here](https://drive.google.com/a/umich.edu/file/d/0B0dHApcloVBkVElBMDU0NDk3NGc/view?usp=sharing).
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/FastSlice/Extension.git`.

To test the extension, follow the instructions for:
* [Bone and nerve selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJFSeH6n0QE).
* [Multi-slice support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjxMnqFd-Y).
